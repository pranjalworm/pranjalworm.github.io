This project is an attempt to document my photography. It&amp;rsquo;s an open source project and you can checkout the source code here.
I chose StencilJS to create the website over any fancy library/framework because I wanted to have complete end-to-end control over the UI/UX as well as the underlying driving mechanism.
It&amp;rsquo;s still a work in progress.</description></item><item><title>CSS Filter Generator</title><link>https://pranjalworm.github.io/projects/css-filter-generator/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Mar 2021 14:25:34 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://pranjalworm.github.io/projects/css-filter-generator/</guid><description>Project website: https://pranjaldubey.com/css-filter-generator/
This project is based off Barrett Sonntag&amp;rsquo;s codepen.
The problem I faced when using Barrett&amp;rsquo;s version was that I had to try multiple times (sometimes 10-20 times) to get a filter value with loss &amp;lt;= 1. So I created a version where the computation logic keeps spitting filter values till the time it hits a loss of less than equal to 1.
In addition to that I placed all the computation logic inside a web worker so that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t put strain on the main thread.</description></item><item><title>Mandatory Hello World Post</title><link>https://pranjalworm.github.io/post/mandatory-hello-world-post/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Mar 2021 21:33:21 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://pranjalworm.github.io/post/mandatory-hello-world-post/</guid><description>&amp;ldquo;Hello World!&amp;rdquo;
So here it goes.
I did a lot of beginner-level coding in C in my first year at college, it was nice and fun, but then I discovered web development around the start of my second year and immediately I was super-hooked. I remember creating a single index.html page with my name on it and then running to my mother to tell her that I made my first very own webpage!</description></item><item><title>About me</title><link>https://pranjalworm.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pranjalworm.github.io/about/</guid><description>Welcome to my little home on the Internet.
