So I created a version where the computation logic keeps spitting filter values till the time it hits a loss of less than equal to 1.</p>\n<p>In addition to that I placed all the computation logic inside a web worker so that it doesn't put strain on the main thread.</p>\n<p>You can checkout the source code <a href=\"https://github.com/pranjalworm/css-filter-generator/\">here</a>.</p>\n","date":"2021-03-19","description":"A tool to create css image filters.
