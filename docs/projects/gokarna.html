<p>The conductor yelled "Gokarna" and I jumped awake in the bus' upper sleeping berth, barely managing not to hit my head on the roof. I checked the time; I wasn't expecting to reach Gokarna at least for another half an hour. But here I was. I yelled back at him to wait for me to get off. I grabbed my stuff, stepped down into the bus' narrow aisle, managed to drag my traveling slippers with my feet and was almost out of the cabin when I remembered I forgot my earplugs in the side pocket of the berth where I was sleeping. I am forgetful like that. I went back and pulled out my precious earplugs and then finally stepped down all alone onto an unmarked road at 5:30 in the morning.</p>
<p>This was my second trip to Gokarna and the first "solo trip" of my life. I had come here with just a one way ticket and other than that I had no plans, no hotel bookings and even no expectations whatsoever. The "planned" part of the trip had ended as soon as I had stepped off that bus, which was a distant white spot by now down the road. It felt quite strange standing there alone. This was the first time when I was going to be responsible for all the decisions on a trip. "This is going to be fun", I thought to myself.</p>
<p>I looked in both the directions, picked one and started walking. I had not been on this road on my previous trip but somehow I knew where to go. The sea has a way of calling out to you.</p>
<p>Gokarna is a little town in Karnataka on the west coast of India. The first time I went there was in 2017 and since then I've been there four more times. There's something about that place which keeps pulling me back.</p>
