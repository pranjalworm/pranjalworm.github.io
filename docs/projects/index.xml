This project is an attempt to document my photography. It&amp;rsquo;s an open source project and you can checkout the source code here.
I chose StencilJS to create the website over any fancy library/framework because I wanted to have complete end-to-end control over the UI/UX as well as the underlying driving mechanism.
It&amp;rsquo;s still a work in progress.</description></item><item><title>CSS Filter Generator</title><link>https://pranjalworm.github.io/projects/css-filter-generator/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Mar 2021 14:25:34 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://pranjalworm.github.io/projects/css-filter-generator/</guid><description>Project website: https://pranjaldubey.com/css-filter-generator/
This project is based off Barrett Sonntag&amp;rsquo;s codepen.
The problem I faced when using Barrett&amp;rsquo;s version was that I had to try multiple times (sometimes 10-20 times) to get a filter value with loss &amp;lt;= 1. So I created a version where the computation logic keeps spitting filter values till the time it hits a loss of less than equal to 1.
In addition to that I placed all the computation logic inside a web worker so that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t put strain on the main thread.</description></item></channel></rss>
