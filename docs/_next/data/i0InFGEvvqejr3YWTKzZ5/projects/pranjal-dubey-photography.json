{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"pranjal-dubey-photography","contentHtml":"<p><img src=\"/images/pranjal-dubey-photography-thumb.webp\" alt=\"Pranjal Dubey Photography\" title=\"Silhouette of a man\"></p>\n<p>Project website: <a href=\"https://pranjaldubey.photography\">https://pranjaldubey.photography</a></p>\n<p>This project is an attempt to document my photography. It's an open source project and you can checkout the source code <a href=\"https://github.com/pranjalworm/click\" title=\"Source code of Pranjal Dubey Photography\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Originally I chose <a href=\"https://https://stenciljs.com/\" title=\"StencilJS\">StencilJS</a> to create the website over any fancy library/framework because I wanted to have complete end-to-end control over the UI/UX as well as the underlying driving mechanism.</p>\n<p>But a while back I noticed that StencilJS is gradually losing steam. People are raising issues and creating pull requests but the project owners are not responding. There <a href=\"https://stenciljs.com/blog\" title=\"StencilJS Blog\">blog</a> was last updated in 2019! I think sooner or later it's officially going to get dumped.</p>\n<p>Currently my website has a bunch of performance and UX issues and I'm getting a little tired of developing everything from scratch. So I have looked around and <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/\" title=\"NextJS\">NextJS</a> seems to be the perfect alternative. It has excellent support for developing image heavy websites, it's extensively documented and also there is a lot of traction for it in the market.</p>\n<p>I am going to port this project's entire codebase to NextJS. It's going to take a lot of sweat and blood to do this migration but I think it'll be beneficial in the long run. </p>\n","date":"2021-05-01","description":"An ongoing attempt to document my photography.","title":"Pranjal Dubey Photography","draft":false}},"__N_SSG":true}
