I checked the time; I wasn't expecting to reach Gokarna at least for another half an hour. But here I was. I yelled back at him to wait for me to get off. I grabbed my stuff, stepped down into the bus' narrow aisle, managed to drag my traveling slippers with my feet and was almost out of the cabin when I remembered I forgot my earplugs in the side pocket of the berth where I was sleeping. I am forgetful like that. I went back and pulled out my precious earplugs and then finally stepped down all alone onto an unmarked road at 5:30 in the morning.</p>\n<p>This was my second trip to Gokarna and the first \"solo trip\" of my life. As I was standing there alone, it felt quite strange as I was the only traveler who got off the bus at that stop, which is usually not the case. I looked both ways, picked a direction and started walking. I had not been on this road on my previous trip but somehow I knew where to go. The sea has a way of calling out to you.</p>\n<p>Gokarna is a little town in Karnataka on the west coast of India. The first time I went there was in 2017 and since then I've been there four more times.</p>\n<div class=\"post-image-wrapper\">\n  <img src=\"/images/bicycle.webp\" class=\"post-image\" />\n  <div class=\"post-image-caption\">\n    What's routine for one, could be breathtaking for another.\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p>I've seen this kulfi vendor cycling on the main beach multiple times across my visits. I've never seen him up close and I have no idea what he looks like, but the next I see him, I am definitely going to him this photograph. I have a hunch that he will like it.</p>\n<div class=\"post-image-wrapper\">\n  <img src=\"/images/pranjal-dubey-photography-thumb.webp\" class=\"post-image\" alt=\"Silhouette of a fisherman\" />\n  <div class=\"post-image-caption\">\n    It's never the instrument.
