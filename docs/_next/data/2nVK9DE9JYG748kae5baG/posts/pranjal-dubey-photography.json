It's an open source project and you can checkout the source code <a href=\"https://github.com/pranjalworm/click\" title=\"Source code of Pranjal Dubey Photography\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>I chose <a href=\"https://https://stenciljs.com/\" title=\"StencilJS\">StencilJS</a> to create the website over any fancy library/framework because I wanted to have complete end-to-end control over the UI/UX as well as the underlying driving mechanism.</p>\n<p>Currently my website has a bunch of performance and UX issues and I'm getting a little tired of developing everything from scratch. So I have looked around and <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/\" title=\"NextJS\">NextJS</a> seems to be the perfect alternative. It has excellent support for developing image heavy websites, it's extensively documented and also there is a lot of traction for it in the market.</p>\n<p>Maybe at some point in the future I will port this project's entire codebase to NextJS. It's going to take a lot of sweat and tears to do this migration but I think it'll be beneficial in the long run.</p>\n","date":"2021-05-01","description":"An ongoing attempt to document my photography.","title":"Pranjal Dubey Photography","draft":false,"thumbnail":"pranjal-dubey-photography-thumb.webp","titleSuffix":"Pranjal Dubey"},"suggestedPosts":[{"id":"css-filter-generator","date":"2021-03-19","description":"A tool to create css image filters.
