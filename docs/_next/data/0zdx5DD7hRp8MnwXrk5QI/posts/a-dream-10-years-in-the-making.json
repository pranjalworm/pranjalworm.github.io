To some it might sound trivial but for me it was a dream 10 years in the making. Let me tell you how it came fruition.</p>\n<p>I grew up fascinated with Apple and its products. The first ever Apple product and that used was the iPod Shuffle. Cute little thing with no display and a dead simple button interface. I still have it lying around somewhere in one my table's drawers. The small orange light still glows up when I try to connect but it doesn't respond otherwise. I used that gadget quite extensively, all the while getting interested in Apple, the company.</p>\n<p>My next interaction with an Apple product happened when a (rich) friend bought an iPhone 3GS. It was such a marvelous piece of beauty. I fell in love with the hardware and software; the Cover Flow UI for showing album art covers, the way lists bounced a little when you reached the end. The phone felt so premium to hold and the feather touch did actually work as advertised.</p>\n","title":"A Dream 10 Years in the Making","date":"2021-04-16","draft":true,"description":"The quick brown fox jumps right over the lazy dog","thumbnail":"three-girlfriends.webp","titleSuffix":"Pranjal Dubey"},"suggestedPosts":[{"id":"mandatory-hello-world-post","date":"2021-03-18","draft":false,"title":"Mandatory Hello World Post","description":"Well it would be almost rude from the perspective of a programmer not to begin with a Hello World post.","thumbnail":"pranjal-dubey.webp"},{"id":"pranjal-dubey-photography","date":"2021-05-01","description":"An ongoing attempt to document my photography.","title":"Pranjal Dubey Photography","draft":false,"thumbnail":"pranjal-dubey-photography-thumb.webp"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
