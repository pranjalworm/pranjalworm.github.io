<p>The conductor yelled "Gokarna" and I jumped awake in the bus' upper sleeping berth, barely managing not to hit my head on the roof. I checked the time; I wasn't expecting to reach Gokarna at least for another half an hour. But here I was. I yelled back at him to wait for me to get off. I grabbed my stuff, stepped down into the bus' narrow aisle, managed to drag my traveling slippers with my feet and was almost out of the cabin when I remembered I forgot my earplugs in the side pocket of the berth where I was sleeping. I am forgetful like that. I went back and pulled out my precious earplugs and then finally stepped down all alone onto an unmarked road at 5:30 in the morning.</p>
<p>This was my second trip to Gokarna and the first "solo trip" of my life. As I was standing there alone, it felt quite strange as I was the only traveler who got off the bus at that stop, which is usually not the case. I looked both ways, picked a direction and started walking. I had not been on this road on my previous trip but somehow I knew where to go. The sea has a way of calling out to you.</p>
<p>Gokarna is a little town in Karnataka on the west coast of India. The first time I went there was in 2017 and since then I've been there four more times.</p>
