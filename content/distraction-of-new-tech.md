During the time when I was developing this website, the only constant thought that I had was: <i>I'll wrap up the dev work as soon as possible and then I'm gonna write my ass off!</i> I really wanted to start writing on a consistent basis. One post per week. Four posts per month. But after writing the first post itself I couldn't bring myself to write another one.

I kept fiddling around with the design of the website, tweaking the UI, adding features and improving code structure and I really enjoyed doing all that but didn't actually use it for its intended purpose: Blogging.

I kept finding ways to avoid it, always thinking that I'll properly start writing once the website was absolutely perfect, because right now it's not performant enough, or it's missing Dark Mode, or ooh there's this new framework around which promises zero client side javascript by default (<a target="_blank" href="https://astro.build">Astro</a>), maybe it'll be a good idea to rewrite my entire website from scratch. For context currently this website is built using <a target="_blank" href="https://nextjs.org/">NextJS</a>.

There's always this attraction towards the latest fastest shiny thing, because it promises that just a little bit extra. And it's not just in the world of coding. It's the same thing with gadgets too. The latest iPhone is (obviously) better than your current iPhone. The latest model of your computer has a faster processor and insane disk speeds. The latest Kindle has USB-C and it is water resistant! The latest Sony headphones have better noise cancellation. The list goes on and on.

Each time a new model of a gadget comes out Youtube's feed saturates with content oozing with superlatives. We are bombarded with a plethora of miniscule delta gains over and over again till the time we start feeling that maybe we do <i>need</i> that extra power, that extra battery life, that extra bright display.

I currently have an iPhone 11. It is three years old, it has a few scratches here and there and the battery life is not that great anymore. The latest iPhone (iPhone 14) has a 30%-40% better processor, better battery life and promises a jaw dropping camera. But do I really need it?
