When I was a kid I got hooked onto reading comics and books. I would spend hours at a time just glommed on to a thick book with my nose deep into its pages and my mind lost in its world. I imagined living alongside the characters and I loved to be a part of their adventures.

Soon enough I felt I wanted to create my own worlds and my own characters. So I started writing, all sorts of stuff, stories, poems & articles. Now I don't know if any of the stuff I wrote at the time was any good or not (most probably it would be the latter), but I wrote because I liked writing. In fact I <i>loved</i> writing.

Over the years my habit of reading has largely stuck with me (although there have been some ups and downs) but gradually I lost my habit of writing and I haven't done any substantial writing in the past decade. But a couple of years back I started feeling pangs for that old habit. I wanted to bring that buried writer in me back to life.

So I started developing this website sometime early last year and my purpose behind it was to create a platform for myself where I could start blogging. I looked around at the frameworks/libraries available and NextJS seemed pretty good to me for the job. It had Static Site Generation and that was all that I needed. I came across Shu Uesugi's <a href="https://next-learn-starter.vercel.app/" target="_blank">blog template</a> while going through the docs and really liked its simple and elegant design. I hacked it around into its current form which you are reading on.

During the whole time when I was developing this website, the only constant thought that I had was: <i>I'll wrap up the dev work as soon as possible and then I'm gonna write my ass off!</i> I really wanted to start writing on a consistent basis. One post per week. Four posts per month. But after writing the first post itself I couldn't bring myself to write another one.

I kept fiddling around with the design of the website, tweaking the UI, adding features and improving code structure and I really enjoyed doing all that but I didn't actually use the website for its intended purpose: Writing.

I was always thinking that I'll properly start writing once the website was absolutely perfect, because right now it's not performant enough, or it's missing Dark Mode, or ooh wait a minute, there's this new framework around which promises zero client side javascript by default (<a target="_blank" href="https://astro.build">Astro</a>), maybe it'll be a good idea to rewrite my entire website from scratch.

I feel there's always this attraction towards the latest fastest shiny thing, because it promises that just a little bit extra. And quite frankly it's so damn frustrating sometimes. You come across a new tech, you find it attractive and start thinking about what you could do with it. Soon enough an idea pops into your head and you dump your existing side projects and give every second of your spare time to this one thing. And then just when you start feeling you are near the finish line, you come across this amazing new piece of tech on HackerNews which supposedly has off the charts performance and is blowing away everyone in the dev community. Then you start wondering... Did I make the right choice with my current tech stack?

There are so many new technologies coming out every few months that it's hard to keep up. There's this feeling of dread, this feeling of missing out on the <i>next big thing</i>.

And it's not just in the world of coding. It's the same thing with gadgets too. The latest iPhone is (obviously) better than your current iPhone. The latest model of your computer has a 20% faster processor and twice the disk speeds. The latest Sony headphones have better noise cancellation. The latest Kindle has USB-C and it is water resistant! The list goes on and on.

Each time a new model of a gadget comes out Youtube's feed saturates with content oozing with superlatives. We are bombarded with a plethora of miniscule delta gains over and over again till the time we start feeling that maybe we do <i>need</i> that extra power, that extra battery life, that extra bright display.

I currently have an iPhone 11. It is three years old, it has a few scratches here and there and the battery life is not that great anymore. The latest iPhone (iPhone 14) has a 30% - 40% better processor, better battery life and promises a jaw dropping camera. But the question is, do I really <i>need</i> it?
