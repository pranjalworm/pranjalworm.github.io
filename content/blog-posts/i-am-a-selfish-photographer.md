There's a poem by Charles Bukowski

#### So You Want To Be A Writer


*if it doesn't come bursting out of you*

*in spite of everything,*

*don't do it.*

*unless it comes unasked out of your*

*heart and your mind and your mouth*

*and your gut,*

*don't do it.*

*if you have to sit for hours*

*staring at your computer screen*

*or hunched over your*

*typewriter*

*searching for words,*

*don't do it.*

*if you're doing it for money or*

*fame,*

*don't do it.*

*if you're doing it because you want*

*women in your bed,*

*don't do it.*

*if you have to sit there and*

*rewrite it again and again,*

*don't do it.*

*if it's hard work just thinking about doing it,*

*don't do it.*

*if you're trying to write like somebody*

*else,*

*forget about it.*

*if you have to wait for it to roar out of*

*you,*

*then wait patiently.*

*if it never does roar out of you,*

*do something else.*



*if you first have to read it to your wife*

*or your girlfriend or your boyfriend*

*or your parents or to anybody at all,*

*you're not ready.*



*don't be like so many writers,*

*don't be like so many thousands of*

*people who call themselves writers,*

*don't be dull and boring and*

*pretentious, don't be consumed with self-*

*love.*

*the libraries of the world have*

*yawned themselves to*

*sleep*

*over your kind.*

*don't add to that.*

*don't do it.*

*unless it comes out of*

*your soul like a rocket,*

*unless being still would*

*drive you to madness or*

*suicide or murder,*

*don't do it.*

*unless the sun inside you is*

*burning your gut,*

*don't do it.*



*when it is truly time,*

*and if you have been chosen,*

*it will do it by*

*itself and it will keep on doing it*

*until you die or it dies in you.*

*there is no other way.*



*and there never was.*

Just like Bukowski, his poem is also quite controversial. It can be argued that people are not *born* writers, photographers & painters. Maybe they are naturally better than others at doing something but it's only through their sheer hard work they are able to create art which make people stop and take notice and think. They push themselves to the very limits and even beyond that to create something which is truly a masterpiece.

But I think for me it rings quite close to what I am like as a creative person. I am usually not able to force myself to create photographs. 

I am not dependent on photography for my survival as I am a programmer by profession and that gives me the freedom of choosing my paid photoshoots.
