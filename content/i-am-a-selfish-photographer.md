There's a poem by Charles Bukowski

#### So You Want To Be A Writer

_if it doesn't come bursting out of you_

_in spite of everything,_

_don't do it._

_unless it comes unasked out of your_

_heart and your mind and your mouth_

_and your gut,_

_don't do it._

_if you have to sit for hours_

_staring at your computer screen_

_or hunched over your_

_typewriter_

_searching for words,_

_don't do it._

_if you're doing it for money or_

_fame,_

_don't do it._

_if you're doing it because you want_

_women in your bed,_

_don't do it._

_if you have to sit there and_

_rewrite it again and again,_

_don't do it._

_if it's hard work just thinking about doing it,_

_don't do it._

_if you're trying to write like somebody_

_else,_

_forget about it._

_if you have to wait for it to roar out of_

_you,_

_then wait patiently._

_if it never does roar out of you,_

_do something else._

_if you first have to read it to your wife_

_or your girlfriend or your boyfriend_

_or your parents or to anybody at all,_

_you're not ready._

_don't be like so many writers,_

_don't be like so many thousands of_

_people who call themselves writers,_

_don't be dull and boring and_

_pretentious, don't be consumed with self-_

_love._

_the libraries of the world have_

_yawned themselves to_

_sleep_

_over your kind._

_don't add to that._

_don't do it._

_unless it comes out of_

_your soul like a rocket,_

_unless being still would_

_drive you to madness or_

_suicide or murder,_

_don't do it._

_unless the sun inside you is_

_burning your gut,_

_don't do it._

_when it is truly time,_

_and if you have been chosen,_

_it will do it by_

_itself and it will keep on doing it_

_until you die or it dies in you._

_there is no other way._

_and there never was._

Just like Bukowski, his poem is also quite controversial. It can be argued that people are not _born_ writers, photographers & painters. Maybe they are naturally better than others at doing something but it's only through their sheer hard work they are able to create art which make people stop and take notice and think. They push themselves to the very limits and even beyond that to create something which is truly a masterpiece.

But I think for me it rings quite close to what I am like as a creative person. I am usually not able to force myself to create photographs.

I am not dependent on photography for my survival as I am a programmer by profession and that gives me the freedom of choosing my paid photoshoots.
