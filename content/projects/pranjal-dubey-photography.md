Project website: https://pranjaldubey.photography

This project is an attempt to document my photography. It's an open source project and you can checkout the source code [here](https://github.com/pranjalworm/click "Source code of Pranjal Dubey Photography").

I chose [StencilJS](https://https://stenciljs.com/ "StencilJS") to create the website over any fancy library/framework because I wanted to have complete end-to-end control over the UI/UX as well as the underlying driving mechanism.

It's still a work in progress...
