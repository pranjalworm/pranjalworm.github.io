The conductor yelled "Gokarna" and I jumped awake in the bus' upper sleeping berth, barely managing not to hit my head on the roof. I checked the time; I wasn't expecting to reach Gokarna at least for another half an hour. But here I was. I yelled back at him to wait for me to get off. I grabbed my stuff, stepped down into the bus' narrow aisle, managed to drag my traveling slippers with my feet and was almost out of the cabin when I remembered I forgot my earplugs in the side pocket of the berth where I was sleeping. I am forgetful like that. I went back and pulled out my precious earplugs and then finally stepped down all alone onto an unmarked road at 5:30 in the morning.

This was my second trip to Gokarna and the first "solo trip" of my life. I had come here with just a one way ticket and other than that I had no plans, no hotel bookings and even no expectations whatsoever. The "planned" part of the trip had ended as soon as I had stepped off that bus, which was a distant white spot by now down the road. It felt quite strange standing there alone. This was the first time when I was going to be responsible for all the decisions on a trip. "This is going to be fun", I thought to myself.

I looked in both the directions, picked one and started walking. I had not been on this road on my previous trip but somehow I knew where to go. The sea has a way of calling out to you.

Gokarna is a little town in Karnataka on the west coast of India. The first time I went there was in 2017 and since then I've been there four more times. There's something about that place which keeps pulling me back.

I've seen this kulfi vendor cycling on the main beach multiple times across my visits. I've never seen him up close and I have no idea what his face looks like, but I think I'll recognise him the next I see him, I am going to give him this photograph. I have a hunch that he'll like it.

Who knows one day when I think I have had enough of "life" and seen everything that I ever wanted to see, I might decide to retire here and end up like this chilled out old dude, walking on the beaches of Gokarna, reminiscing the good old days.
