This project is an attempt to document my photography. It's an open source project and you can checkout the source code [here](https://github.com/pranjalworm/click 'Source code of Pranjal Dubey Photography').

I chose [StencilJS](https://https://stenciljs.com/ 'StencilJS') because something about it's design and arch approach really appealed to me. Also I didn't want the overhead of loading a fancy framework in a image heavy website.
