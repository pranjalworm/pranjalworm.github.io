Project website: [Pranjal Dubey Photography](https://pranjaldubey.photography "Pranjal Dubey Photography")

This project is an attempt to document my photography. It's an open source project and you can checkout the source code [here](https://github.com/pranjalworm/click "Source code of Pranjal Dubey Photography").

I chose [StencilJS](https://https://stenciljs.com/ "StencilJS") to create the website over any fancy library/framework because I wanted to have complete end-to-end control over the UI/UX as well as the underlying driving mechanism.

Currently my website has a bunch of performance and UX issues and I'm getting a little tired of developing everything from scratch. So I have looked around and [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/ "NextJS") seems to be the perfect alternative. It has excellent support for developing image heavy websites, it's extensively documented and also there is a lot of traction for it in the market.

Maybe at some point in the future I will port this project's entire codebase to NextJS. It's going to take a lot of sweat and tears to do this migration but I think it'll be beneficial in the long run.
